To keep up with the Azure Updates I used to listen to CloudSkills.fm while I drive to work back and forth. Being mostly working and deploying Azure Infrastructure in the Waterfall method I was intrigued with the awesome content by Mike Pfiffer on the podcasts

With the interest flowing into my veins with Agile way of approaching the Cloud Infrastructure Deployments and doing Automation with DevOps practices and the eagerness I had to learn IaC [Infrastructure as Code] with Terraform and further improve on ARM with the few skills I had with ARM Templates, and wanting to learn how Containers Works specially Kubernetes after seeing how Kelsey Hightowers inpirational Keynotes. And after much consideration gave it it a go with CloudSkill.io DevOps Boot Camp with the offer they had for $497 and no doubt thats one of the best investment I have done

Going through the program and labs I got to admit that I was utterly facinated with Azure DevOps, part of this blog I am going to break it down in the simplest way possible to a Windows Sys Admin the way of life with DevOps and Azure DevOps or may be document my jounery on what I learn where I struggle.

I am still uncertain how far I can master but unless you buckle up and move forward you wont see the unseen.
