Sabir Mohamed, that's my name :) working for Visolit as a Lead Consultant, while I drive team Consultants, having Primary Focus to help Visolit customers to leverage The Azure cloud which is an ever-expanding set of amazing services. Our team strives to listen, understand, and help the customers address their business challenges with the power of Azure while helping the Cloud Operations to govern the workloads.

Along with this, I play a Platform Azure Developer Role for Visolit CCoE Team, The Visolit Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is a central, cross-functional team in Visolit that develops, manages, and owns the Visolit cloud strategies, standards, and principles and the integrity of the practices. This is where I learned all about Azure DevOps, practice IaC using CI/CD.

Apart from my Cloud Career Journey, I am a passionate motorsport guy and working on my car and learning the basics of drifting. Soon hoping to share my build on another page.
