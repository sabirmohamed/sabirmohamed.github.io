I am working as a Cloud Solution Architect at [Visolit](https://www.visolit.net/about-us). While I help Visolit customers to adopt and leverage Azure, I also play a Azure Developer Role for Visolit CCoE Team, The Visolit Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is a central, cross-functional team in Visolit that develops, manages, and owns the Visolit cloud strategies, standards, and principles and the integrity of the practices. This is where I Architect/Develop Platform Automation Componenets with  Infratructure as Code and Deploying using CI/CD and contributing to automate everything as code in CSP perpective.

I am still in the progress of finding my real calling but what drives me in my career is

- Listening to customer pain points and addressing that with Technology 
- Continous Learning and share knowledge and insights to lift my collegues on the Cloud and DevOps Journey
- Help others to Embrace and Adopt DevOps Culture.

Apart from my Career Journey, I am a passionate motorsports guy who love working on my car and learning the basics of drifting. Here is a pic of my car ðŸ‘‹
