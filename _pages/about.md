Hey, I am Sabir, playing a Cloud Solution Architect role at [Visolit](https://www.visolit.net/about-us). While I help Visolit customers to adopt and leverage Azure by Consulting, I also play a Azure Developer Role for Visolit [CCoE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) Team.

The Visolit Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is a central, cross-functional team in Visolit that develops, manages, and owns the Visolit cloud strategies, standards, and principles and the integrity of the practices. This is where I Architect/Develop Platform Automation Components with  Infrastructure as Code and Deploying using CI/CD and contributing to automate everything as code in CSP perspective.

Part of this blog I am going to break it down in the simplest way possible to any beginner level engineer on DevOps and Azure DevOps or maybe document my journey on what I learn where I struggle.
